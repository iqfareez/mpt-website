# Works Offline

The Malaysia prayer time app includes an offline feature, allowing users to access prayer times and other information
**without an internet connection**. This is useful for users who are traveling or in remote areas, as well as for those
who
want to conserve data usage. The offline feature provides convenient access to necessary information even when an
internet connection is not available.

It is important to note that this feature does have limitations. Specifically, if a user changes their location, they
will need to have an internet connection in order to pull the latest data for their new location. It is therefore
recommended that users ensure they have an internet connection when changing locations in order to ensure that the app
can provide accurate and up-to-date information.
