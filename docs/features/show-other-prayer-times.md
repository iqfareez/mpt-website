By default, the app only shows five main prayer times. However, you can choose to show other prayer times, ie **Imsak, Sunrise (Syuruk), & Dhuha** easily.

## Follow the simple steps below

1. Go to Menu > **Settings**.
2. On the second option, you'll find an option named **Shows other times**. Toggle the switch to ON.

:::info

Imsak, Sunrise and Dhuha times are always shown on **Full Timetable page**.
