# Notification issues

## What is it about?

For some OEMs (eg: Xiaomi, Oppo etc.), implements a _little too aggresive_ battery optimization feature. Crucial features like **Autostart** and **Run in background** for some apps are disabled by default. In that case, prayer notification can only be shown for a while, or worse, cannot be shown to you altogether.
